# Data science project: Forecasting Food Retailer
Data science project to forecast retail sales from a large grocery chain using Machine Learning algorithms.

This is a **Machine Learning project**, where the main goal is to develope a machine learning model able to run in batch mode, API or Web App for further model explotation in a real business scenario. It includes data cleaning process, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, ML modeling and deployment code.

All the project is carried out using Jupyter Notebooks (Python).

## Context
A large grocery chain wants to forecast the sales of 10 food products, sold in 2 of their stores. 

The business managers have outsourced this project to a data scientist to deliver a machine learning product able to be run in batch mode. In this way the model can be reused at any time in the future and thus keep adding value to the business.

</p>

As a starting point, a SQL database is provided containing 3 years of selling records for each product and store.

## Methodology

### 1. Project setup


### 2. Data cleaning process

- **Renting price**: the greater the renting price the greater the revenue.
- **Availability**: generally the more days the property is occupied for renting the greater the revenue (more demand).
- **Property price**: the cheaper the property the greater the revenue.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


### 4. Feature Engineering


### 5. Model development


### 6. Analysis and insights


### 7. Communication
For this project a report was generated, communicating all the analysis and found insights.
The report can be checked in the following file:

## BONUS: Lessons learnt

- Cleaning data is not so straightforward. That's why analysing data is an iterative process, because normally some data quality problems are only found at later stages during data analysis processes rather than during the cleaning process.

- It is very difficult to have all the data. Many assumptions are made during the process due to lacking information. Then, the more data (and more relevant) we can have the better is the approach to any problem.

- Business knowledge is very helpful. Making the correct questions is key when looking for data insights. Sometimes an analytical mindset is enough, but business knowledge about the project topic can accelerate the analysis process.
