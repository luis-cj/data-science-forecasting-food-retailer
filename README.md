# Data science project: Forecasting Food Retailer
Data science project to forecast retail sales from a large grocery chain using Machine Learning algorithms.

This is a **Machine Learning project**, where the main goal is to develope a machine learning model able to run in batch mode, API or Web App for further model explotation in a real business scenario. It includes data cleaning process, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, ML modeling and deployment code.

All the project is carried out using Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts.

## Context
A large grocery chain wants to forecast the sales of 10 food products, sold in 2 of their stores. 

The business managers have outsourced this project to a data scientist to deliver a machine learning product able to be run in batch mode. In this way the model can be reused at any time in the future and thus keep adding value to the business.
