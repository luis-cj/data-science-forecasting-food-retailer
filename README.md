# Data science project: Forecasting Food Retailer
Data science project to forecast retail sales from a large grocery chain using a multi-step forecasting Machine Learning algorithm.

This is a **Machine Learning project**, where the main goal is to develope a machine learning model able to run in batch mode, API or Web App for further model explotation in a real business scenario. It includes data cleaning process, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, ML modeling and retraining and deployment code.

All the project is carried out using Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts.

## Context
A large grocery chain wants to forecast the sales of 10 food products, sold in 2 of their stores. In order for them to provide the most value, they would like to have a forecast of their sales 8 days in advance, so they can avoid shortage of products and reduce operative costs in their stores.

The business managers have outsourced this project to a data scientist to deliver a machine learning product able to be run in batch mode. In this way the model can be reused at any time in the future and thus keep adding value to the business.

</p>

As a starting point, a SQL database is provided containing 3 years of selling records for each product and store.

## Methodology

### 1. Objective

Develope a multi-step forecasting Machine Learning model that can predict sales for each product on each store within the next following 8 days from the data collection.


### 2. Data collection and setup

Data is provided in a SQL database provided by the business owners.

Three different datasets are provided, corresponding to:

- Calendar

- Sales

- Prices

All of the datasets are joined as it is shown in the following Jupyter notebook:

### 3. Data cleaning

This part involves checking data types and general data quality. The main steps in this phase are cleaning and processing data from missing values and outliers that the original dataset may contain.

Data cleaning can be checked in the following Jupyter Notebook:
